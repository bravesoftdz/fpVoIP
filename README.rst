About
=====

The following ambitious library attempt to create a pure Object Pascal library
to handle Voice Over IP Protocols such as SIP, IAX2, XMPP and also RTP, SDP and
all other related protocols.

The library is created by LINESIP under the MPL 1.1 license and you can use it
as GPL instead.


Codecs
======
I hope also to create support for codecs such as ITU G7xx, BroadVoice, iLBC,
AMR, SPEEX, GSM, CELT, Opus and more.

At the beginning I will focus on SIP and G711 in pure Object Pascal.

Sockets
=======
The socket implementation in this library is not a real implementation but a
wrapper API for such.

You can choose any type of socket library you wish such as:

* Synaptic
* lNET
* Indy

And more, It's all up to you.

Audio
=====
The following library does not implement audio playing per-se, you should do it
yourself.

Video
=====
I hope that in the feature this library will support also Video/image codecs
and you will be require to display it like you wish.

Text
====
The following library will implement text support of SIP, IAX2 and I hope also
to implement XMPP (Jabber) protocol at the end as well.
