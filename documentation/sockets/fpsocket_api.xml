        <short>Socket API unit that is used by fpVoIP in this project</short>
        <descr>
          <b>About</b>
The following unit contain a single API for socket handling for the whole fpVoIP library, so there is only one API to take care of.

The unit does not implement any socket connection,  and for that any socket connection library should be implemented in the "driver" sub directory, based on the socket library, and inheriting from the classes at this unit.</descr>
